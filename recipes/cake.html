    <h1>Hershey Cake</h1>
    <img src="../img/cake.jpg" alt="Hershey cake" width="200">
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The original Hershey's chocolate cake, 
        which was made with six candy bars, was developed post-World War II. Americans loved the recipe because it celebrated 
        the end of food shortages and, thus, 
        the end of the war years.
        When you hear the phrase "Hershey's 
        chocolate cake" these days, you'll 
        likely think of Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake — 
        the recipe found on the back of 
        the brand's unsweetened cocoa powder box.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa,
            baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an 
            electric mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand.</li>
        <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes 
            before removing from pans to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. 
            Beat to a smooth spreading consistency.</li>
        <li>Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, 
            then stack them onto a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.</li>
    </ol>
